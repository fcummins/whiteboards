Goal: make my whiteboards discoverable, searchable, and more use than
they currently are.

Modelled on my experiences with the Joint Speech Archive.  Using the
same template: a database with 3 tables.  One for the real things (the
boards), one for tags, and one linking tags to boards.

It will be a fun job tagging and transcribing the boards.  For each
board I want text and tags.  Images will be hauled in from Flickr
(probably using iFrame).

It would be nice if I could automate the adding process up to, but not
including, reading and transcribing the board.  What would that
involve?

Skinning to get away from the UCD theme can be done on my own time.
